# AddButtonsToTopOfKeyboard
A simple project showing how to use UIResponder.inputAccessoryView

When showing the NumberPadKeyboard there is no return key to be used for dismissing the keyboard. 

This project shows how to place a UIToolBar above the keyboard with a done button, or a custom view with custom buttons to be attached to the top of the keyboard.
